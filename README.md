# ROQQU Technical Interview
> Task: I was required to convert pages 3 and 4 from an adobe xd UI design

## HOW TO RUN THE APP
> Fork and Clone the Repository to your Local Machine
> 
> Navigate to the parent folder using the CMD
> 
> Run npm start
> 
> Visit localhost:3000
> 
> Voila!, your web app is now powered up and ready!

### ADDED FEATURES
> Orderbook's data is consumed from binance's API
>
> CandleSticks real-time data is also streamed from binance's API using websockets

### MINOR ISSUES
> Incomplete Icons and SVGs from the Design, Had to use other icons in replacement
> 
> Not responsive and mobile friendly as I was required to achieve that from the task
> 
> CandleSticks are not Updated in Realtime as I didn't have enough time to implement that before the deadline
